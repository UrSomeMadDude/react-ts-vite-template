# React + TS + Vite template

A base project stored in a repository to reduce time spent on project setup

## Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/UrSomeMadDude/react-ts-vite-template
# Go to the project directory
cd react-ts-vite-template
# Install all dependencies (node version - 20+)
yarn
# Start the server in dev mode
yarn dev
```

## Basic configuration

-   React router
-   sass
-   classnames
-   react-router, react-router-dom,
-   eslint, stage lint and commit lint support

When using, you are free to change structure and architecture however you want. I provided the minimum base to start with

By default, commitlint uses Conventiobnal commits, but you are free to use configs that suit you more
